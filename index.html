                        <h2>How does the coronavirus spread?</h2>
                        <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus
                            particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings,
                            coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny
                            infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where
                            many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand
                            hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</p>
                        <h2>How did the coronavirus start?</h2>
                        <p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new
                            coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal and changed
                            (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease
                            outbreaks have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals
                            that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues, and more study may reveal
                            how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.</p>
                        <h2>What is the incubation period for COVID-19?</h2>
                        <p>Symptoms show up in people within two to 14 days of exposure to the virus. A person infected
                            with the coronavirus is contagious to others for up to two days before symptoms appear, and
                            they remain contagious to others for 10 to 20 days, depending upon their immune system and
                            the severity of their illness.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</h2>
                        <p>COVID-19 is diagnosed through a test. Diagnosis by examination alone is difficult since many
                            COVID-19 signs and symptoms can be caused by other illnesses. Some people with the
                            coronavirus do not have symptoms at all.&nbsp;<a

                                for COVID-19</a> depends on the severity of the infection. For milder illness, resting
                            at home and taking medicine to reduce fever is often sufficient. More severe cases may
                            require hospitalization, with treatment that might include intravenous medications,
                            supplemental oxygen, assisted ventilation and other supportive measures</p>

                        <h2>Why is it called coronavirus?</h2>
                        <p>Coronaviruses are named for their appearance: “corona” means “crown.” The virus’s outer
                            layers are covered with spike proteins that surround them like a crown.</p>
                        <h2>Is this coronavirus different from SARS?</h2>
                        <p><a
                                href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome#tab=tab_1">SARS</a>&nbsp;stands
                            for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In 2003, an outbreak of SARS affected people in
                            several countries before ending in 2004. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is similar to
                            the one that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.</p>
                        <p>Since the 2019 coronavirus is related to the original coronavirus that caused SARS and can
                            also cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, there is “SARS” in its name: SARS-CoV-2. Much
                            is still unknown about these viruses, but SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and farther than the
                            2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus. This is likely because of how easily it is transmitted person to
                            person, even from asymptomatic carriers of the virus.</p>
                        <h2>Are there different variants of this coronavirus?</h2>
                        <p>Yes, there are different variants of this coronavirus. Like other viruses, the coronavirus
                            that causes COVID-19 can change (mutate). Mutations may enable the coronavirus to spread
                            faster from person to person as in the case of the delta and omicron variants. More
                            infections can result in more people getting very sick and also create more opportunity for
                            the virus to develop further mutations. Read more about&nbsp;<a
